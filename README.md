# Sepideh Shaterian — ML Engineer (Production Inference)
I ship models that are **fast, reliable, and cost-effective**.

**Repos**
- `serving-labs` — ONNX Runtime + KServe/Triton, canary/rollback, dashboards.
- `agentic-labs` — Agent + tools with eval/guardrails wired to CI.
- `perf-labs` — Quantization/batching sweeps → **cost vs P95** plots.
- `ml-from-scratch` — Transformer & Diffusion with tests.
